		In computer networking, the Stream Control Transmission Protocol
		<ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCTP">(SCTP)</ulink>
		is a Transport Layer protocol, serving in a similar role to the
		popular protocols Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User
		Datagram Protocol (UDP). It provides some of the same service features
		of both: it is message-oriented like UDP and ensures reliable,
		in-sequence transport of messages with congestion control like TCP.
	</para>
	<para>
		The protocol was defined by the IETF Signaling Transport (SIGTRAN)
		working group in 2000 and is maintained by the IETF Transport Area
		(TSVWG) working group.
		<ulink url="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4960">RFC 4960</ulink>
		defines the protocol.
		<ulink url="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3286">RFC 3286</ulink>
		provides an introduction.

	<para>
		&THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION;
		is providing the convenient API's over Java SCTP, hence can be used
		only with version JDK 1.7 or above.
	</para>
	<para>
		In addition to exposing the SCTP protocol, &THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION;
		contains number of features which other wise the application depending on
		SCTP will have to take care of. For example &THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION;
		provides

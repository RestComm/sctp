	<title>Association</title>
	<para>
		Association is a protocol relationship between endpoints. Its
		wrapper over actual socket exposing the same API's irrespective
		if its client side socket initiating connection or server side socket
		accepting connection. Also the underlying scoket can be of type TCP or SCTP.
	</para>
	<para>
		The Application using &THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION;
		calls management interface to create new instance of association and
		keeps reference to this instance for lifetime of association for
		seding the PayloadData.
